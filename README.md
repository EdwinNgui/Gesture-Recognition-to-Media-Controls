# GestureRecognition

This was a smaller side project that has helped me learn about different tools to develop projects.__
 ➜ cv2__
 ➜ numpy__
 ➜ mediapipe__
 ➜ pyautogui__

The hand gesture recognition code was forked from https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/hand-gesture-recognition-tensorflow-opencv/ and I had written a smaller piece of code to allow the user to access media control through the camera.

Actions (executes one action at a time as long as the previous is not the same as current; to prevent spammed actions)__
stop / live long = pauses / plays__
thumbs up = volume up__
thumbs down = volume down__
pecae = switches tab__
__
Future Plans__
➜ Would develop this project to help make the product easier to setup/use and have a greater range of actions
