# GestureRecognition

The hand gesture recognition code was forked from https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/hand-gesture-recognition-tensorflow-opencv/ and I had written a smaller piece of code to allow the user to access media control through the camera.<br />

This was a smaller computer vision side project that has helped me explore and learn about various tools used to develop projects such as...<br />
 ➜ cv2<br />
 ➜ numpy<br />
 ➜ mediapipe<br />
 ➜ pyautogui<br />

Actions (executes one action at a time as long as the previous is not the same as current; to prevent spammed actions)<br />
 ➜ stop / live long = pauses / plays<br />
 ➜ thumbs up = volume up<br />
 ➜ thumbs down = volume down<br />
 ➜ pecae = switches tab<br />

Future Plans<br />
➜ Would develop this project to help make the product easier to setup/use and have a greater range of actions<br />
