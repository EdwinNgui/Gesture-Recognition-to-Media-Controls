# GestureRecognition

This was a smaller side project that has helped me learn about different tools to develop projects.
 ➜ cv2
 ➜ numpy
 ➜ mediapipe
 ➜ pyautogui

The hand gesture recognition code was forked from https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/hand-gesture-recognition-tensorflow-opencv/ and I had written a smaller piece of code to allow the user to access media control through the camera.

Actions (executes one action at a time as long as the previous is not the same as current; to prevent spammed actions)
stop / live long = pauses / plays
thumbs up = volume up
thumbs down = volume down
pecae = switches tab

Future Plans
➜ Would develop this project to help make the product easier to setup/use and have a greater range of actions
